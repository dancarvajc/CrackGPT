## Technical Features

- Keyboard functionality within chats mimics that of WhatsApp/Telegram, smartly adjusting the content to the current content offset and starting at the bottom. This is a challenging feat in SwiftUI, especially across various OS versions.
- CoreData is implemented to persist chats and other data locally.
- The generation of PDFs from chats was challenging to implement but is reliable and efficient.
- MVVM with separated layers for Data and Domain logic. So you can change the storage provider and the OpenAI provider easily.
